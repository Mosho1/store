# Introduction

<Name> is a state management library, focused on better developer experience.

The generic store is standalone, but the redux extension uses redux, reselect, and seamless-immutable to provide a modern app state management solution.

Despite being based on redux, it functions similarly (and was influenced by) mobx. 

The idea is to use a class instance that stores our state. All interactions with state are done with through the store instance. Local component state is kept to a minimum.

There are 3 main components to interacting with state:

1. Actions
2. Selectors
3. Connectors

## Actions 

Actions cause a change of the store's state. A decorated action payload creator returns a payload that is then combined (by a "reducer") with the current state with an updated state.

```
class MyStore extends Store<any, any> {
    @action(merge)
    doSomething() {
        return {
            didSomething: true
        };
    }
}
```

`merge` here is what is typically known as a reducer. It's a pure function that implements how an update payload should be integrated into the current state. `merge` in this case can be something like an immutable merge, or `Object.assign`. Another example might be `replace` which replaces the current state in its entirety with the payload. These reducers should be kept concise and descriptive, ideally a single verb.

## Selectors

These are used to extract derived information from the state, typically to be presented in a UI.

```
class MyStore extends Store<any, any> {
    @select(store => store.state.didSomething)
    get thing() {
        return this.state.didSomething ? 'something' : 'nothing';
    }

    @select(store => store.thing)
    get twoThings() {
        return [this.thing, this.thing];
    }
}
```

The redux plugin uses `reselect` internally, which creates getters wrapper in memoized functions that make sure computations are made once for every distinct state.

These work as expected. When the getter is invoked, a check using the provided selectors (e.g. `store => store.thing`) determines if any dependencies changed, and either returns the previous, memoized result or calls the getter to recompute the result.

## Connectors

Used to connect the store to a function. A function decorated with @store.connect(mapState) will receive the mapped state result as an argument.

The redux plugin uses `react-redux`'s `connect`, and will inject props mapped from the store into react components.

# Motivation

## Predictable state

<Name> offers the same benefits as redux, like serializable state, first-class hot reload, and existing ecosystem.

## Reduce boilerplate

Here is the simplest possible typical redux action creator:

```
export const setVisibilityFilter = filter => {
  return {
    type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
    filter
  }
}
```

By using named class methods, `type` can be abstracted away.

## Ease of use

Accessing state and computed properties is easily done via `this`. Calling actions is easily done by calling those actions directly from a reference to the store. The bare minimum additional code is required to have the benefits of immutable, predictable state.
